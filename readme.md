# Formative Solutions Website Template

This is a template for all new Formative Solutions websites, built on NextJS.
This repository is a heavily modified version of the default project generated
using the popular [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app)
tool.

## Running the site locally

Once a local version of the site has been obtained, and after the requisite
dependencies have been installed (using `npm install`), the NextJS development
server can be started locally using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your
browser to see the result.
