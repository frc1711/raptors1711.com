## Running the site locally

Once a local version of the site has been obtained, and after the requisite
dependencies have been installed (using `npm install`), the NextJS development
server can be started locally using the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can then open [http://localhost:1711](http://localhost:1711) with your
browser to see the result.
