			description: "This is Grady’s fourth year on the team, and he’s looking forward to the 2022 build season. With 2020 being cut short and 2021 being virtual, Grady has big goals for the team this year with it being his last. On the rare times where Grady isn’t working on the robot, you can usually find him trying to break into Sage’s safety prize candy safe.",

She’s now a senior and is excited to participate with non tech and safety at comps since she couldn’t last year. When she’s not at robotics, Sage can be found cross-country skiing or starting her AP Lit reductions the night before they’re due.",
